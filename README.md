## Overview

The Gathering improves the experience of in-person ephemeral gatherings, such as conferences, college orientations or other assemblies of communities of affinity.  Gathering attendees use a mobile app to enable automatic person-to-person contact information exchange via libp2p upon the entry of one person's codename, which is printed on his or her lanyard.  Connections (without identifying information) are tallied and tracked by the organizer of the gathering and others running scorekeeper nodes.  Gather incentivizes positive networking behavior through awarding points for recommending matches among one's connections, with several custom ERC721 trophies awarded to the points leaders in various categories at the gathering's conclusion, including trophies for most connections, most matches made and the Kevin Bacon award for the fewest average degrees of separation from all attendees.
